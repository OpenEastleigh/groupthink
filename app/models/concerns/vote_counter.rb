<!-- votebot instructions -->
This proposal is open for discussion and voting. If you are a [contributor](#{ENV['SITE_URL']}/users/) to this repository (and not the proposer), you may vote on whether or not it is accepted.

## How to vote
Vote by entering one of the following symbols in a comment on this pull request. Only your last vote will be counted, and you may change your vote at any time until the change is accepted or closed.

|vote|symbol|type this|points|
|--|--|--|--|
|Yes|:white_check_mark:|`:white_check_mark:`|#{ENV["YES_WEIGHT"]}|
|No|:negative_squared_cross_mark:|`:negative_squared_cross_mark:`|#{ENV["NO_WEIGHT"]}|
|Abstain|:zipper_mouth_face:|`:zipper_mouth_face:`|0|
|Block|:no_entry_sign:|`:no_entry_sign:`|#{ENV["BLOCK_WEIGHT"]}|

Proposals will be accepted and merged once they have a total of #{ENV["PASS_THRESHOLD"]} points when all votes are counted. Votes will be open for a minimum of #{ENV["MIN_AGE"]} days, but will be closed if the proposal is not accepted after #{ENV["MAX_AGE"]}.

Votes are counted [automatically here](#{ENV['SITE_URL']}/proposals/#{number}), and results are set in the merge status checks below.

## Changes

@#{proposer.login}, if you want to make further changes to this proposal, you can do so by [clicking on the pencil icons here](https://github.com/#{ENV['GITHUB_REPO']}/pull/#{number}/files). If a change is made to the proposal, no votes cast before that change will be counted, and votes must be recast.
