<h2>Authors (<%= @authors.count %>)</h2>

<p>
  Authors have had a proposal accepted, and thus under the rules, get voting
  rights on future proposals.

<div class='userlist'>
  <% @authors.each do |user| %>
    <%= render partial: 'shared/person', locals: {person: user } %>
  <% end %>

<h2>Other participants (<%= @others.count %>)</h2>

<p>
  Other participants have either submitted a (so far) unsuccessful proposal, or just taken
  part in the discussion, and do not yet have voting rights.
